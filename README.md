## üí° Key Design Decisions (Responsive CSS)

- **Mobile-First Approach**  
  Base styles defined globally; enhancements applied with media queries.  

- **Breakpoints Used:**
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 900px) { ... }   /* Tablets & smaller laptops */
  @media (max-width: 600px) { ... }   /* Smartphones */
  ```

- **Invoice Table Wrapping:** Prevents horizontal scrolling issues:
  ```css
  th, td {
      word-break: break-word; 
      overflow-wrap: break-word;
  }
  ```
